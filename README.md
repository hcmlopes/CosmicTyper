# Cosmic Typer 2.0

Typer has been updated utilizing Svelte under the hood. This has opened the door to a world of enhancements and growth. The documentation is out of date and currently being worked on.

## Purpose

After observing students learn programming, it became evident that typing was a struggle. Not only does the syntax look weird and scary, but trying to find those characters on the key board is hard. Especially for those who only have experience with tablets or phones. This tools main purpose is to get beginners more comfortable with the keyboard and the special characters, as well as seeing programming syntax often to get comfortable with it.
